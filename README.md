## Pay attention to Branches

```
  bandit-03-alg
  bandit-03-aws
  bandit-04-alg
  bandit-04-aws
* main
```

They contain Bandit scans, direct (-03) and using actions (-04) on two Python 
subdirectories:

```
aws-dynamodb-encryption-python
python-algorithms
```
(Shows how easy is to implement your own custom scans.)
